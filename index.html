                <p> 
                    Hello, I'm Mark MeHaffey. I go by my middle name -- Shuler.
                    I always have and always will. My parents have both blessed me with a unique name and 
                    cursed me by forcing me to have to sometimes, mostly in professional and classroom settings, 
                    explain this to people. 
                    I'd like to thank you for visiting my page 
                    and share with you a little bit about who I am. 
                    Upon graduating from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
                    with a degree in economics I moved to Austin and began working as an 
                    Application Sales Representative for Oracle. <br><br>

                    A combination of my excitment for technology and my joy for problem-solving 
                    has lead me to coding and web development. My exploration into this field started with some self-learning
                    in mid 2018 and has turned into me attending the <a href="https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/">
                    Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.</a> I'm excited for the opportunity to 
                    continue to grow my knowledge, skills and portoflio as I attempt to break into a profession more reliant on 
                    the ability to write code. <br><br>

                    When I'm not working or coding I love watching Tarheel basketball, Volunteer football
                    and the Los Angeles Dodgers. I enjoy reading for recreation and hanging outside with friends.
